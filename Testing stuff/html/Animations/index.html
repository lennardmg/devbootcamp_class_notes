            <p>A juniper berry is the female seed cone produced by the various species of junipers. It is not a true
                berry, but a cone
                with unusually fleshy and merged scales, which gives it a berry-like appearance. The cones from a
                handful of species,
                especially Juniperus communis, are used as a spice, particularly in European cuisine, and also give gin
                its distinctive
                flavour. Juniper berries are among the only spices derived from conifers, along with spruce buds.

            <p><small>Juniper, typically Juniperus communis, is used to flavor gin, a liquor developed in the 17th
                    century in the
                    Netherlands. The name gin itself is derived from either the French geni√®vre or the Dutch jenever,
                    both of which mean
                    "juniper".</small></p>

                <p>The flavor profile of young, green berries is dominated by pinene; as they mature this piney,
                    resinous backdrop is
                    joined by what Harold McGee describes as "green-fresh" and citrus notes. The outer scales of the
                    berries are
                    relatively flavourless, so the berries are almost always at least lightly crushed before being used
                    as a spice. They are
                    used both fresh and dried, but their flavour and odour are at their strongest immediately after
                    harvest and decline
                    during drying and storage.</p>

                <summary>Toxity</summary>
                <p>While classified as generally recognized as safe in the United States, juniper berries may have
                    various side effects
                    that have not been tested extensively in clinical trials. Mainly due to an increased risk of
                    miscarriage, even in
                    small doses, consuming juniper berries may affect pregnant or breastfeeding women, and people with
                    diabetes, bleeding
                    disorders or after surgery. In traditional medicine, juniper berries were thought to be useful for
                    female birth
                    control.

                    Allergic reactions are possible. Consuming large amounts of juniper berries may cause catharsis,
                    convulsions, or harm
                    kidney function.

                <summary>Chemistry</summary>
                <p>Juniper berries contain diverse phytochemicals, including an essential oil in about 2% volume, a
                    flavonoid called
                    juniperin, resins (about 10% of volume), proteins, and acetic, malic and formic acids. From
                    extracts of the berries,
                    fatty acids, terpenes, aromatic compounds, and hydrocarbons, such as pinene, sabinene,
                    terpinen-4-ol, limonene, and
                    myrcene, were isolated.
